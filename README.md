# Naturalness Evaluator

This repository contains the Naturalness Evaluator developed for the thesis titled "Automatic Naturalness Evaluation of Logic-to-Text Generation Systems". 
This tool is designed to assess the naturalness of text generated by logic-to-text generation systems, aiding in the evaluation and improvement of such systems.

## Content
- The primary evaluator notebook can be accessed at [evaluator.ipynb](./evaluator.ipynb).
